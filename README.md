## Future Iterations

### All Pages

- Complete redesign.
  - Nail down the UX before the UI.
  - Redesign the UI in Adobe XD.
    - Make better use of spacing rather than line divisions.
- Recode from ground up using BEM and mobile-first breakpoints.
- Replace all jQuery with vanilla JavaScript.
- Use Airbnb ESLint and CSS style guide.
- Convert to fluid font sizes and use better ratios between headings and main text.
- ADA:
  - Better use of semantic containers and markup. (Example: Add `<cite>` tags around each instance of my project titles.)
  - Check color contrast (text vs. background, etc.).
  - Don't skip heading levels (H1, H2, etc.).
  - See email link I received from Google.
- Performance:
  - Run Google Page Insights and do everything it suggests.
  - Compress all images.
  - Convert any icons to SVG instead of linking to external libraries.
  - Minify all CSS and JS files.
- Tracking:
  - Add Google Analytics tracking across the site.
  - Add consumer notice regarding tracking.
  - Follow GDRP and CCPA guidelines. (Probably don't load tracking in EU, for example.)
- SEO:
  - Review and incorporate best practices for SEO. (And check Google Analytics reports to see if it makes a difference.)


### Homepage

- Header image (Cannon Beach).
- Sign-Up Form overlay on header image.
  - Button text says "Sign Up".
- Full-width block for each book below this, which links out to those pages.


### Global Nav

- Slide in from the side on mobile.
- Fixed on desktop. (Sticky on homepage.)


### Catch Up To Myself | The Druggist

- Convert the Amazon button from an image to code so that it's readable by search engines and screen readers.
- Add the music as a section of each of these pages.
  - Restyle to a grid of album artwork.
  - Figure out the best UI/UX for when user clicks on the artwork to view details.


### Bio

- Change from "About" to "Bio."
- Standardize (and use correct markup for) all project titles in a way that they do not get confused with links -- especially if something is both a link AND a title.
- Redesign -- maybe a clean white background with images alternating left and right.


### Bonus

- Adopt best practices for form.
- Custom-design pages for the following, and set MailChimp to route users there instead:
  - Signup Thank You Page. (Video background.)
  - Confirmation Thank You Page. (Video background.)


### Contact

- Adopt best practices for form.
- Get a newer, better backend email system set up.


### Screenplays (Nice-to-Have)

- Add a page for screenplays. Link to the PDF for that script (pending Mark's -- and in some cases Dave's -- approval).
- Some sort of background artwork that I will probably have to commission.
- Image of script's title page slides in from the left.
- Synopsis on the left.
- "Henchmen Wanted" section will also have embedded video of "Expendable."


## When Finished

- Announce to email list first.
- Announce on social media second.
