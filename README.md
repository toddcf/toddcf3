## Future Iterations

### Novels

- Fix hover link for testimonial citations. (Underline appears, then drops 1px.)

### Short Stories

- Fix hover link for testimonial citations. (Underline appears, then drops 1px.) Only Jon's does not do this for some reason.

### Bonus

### Contact

- Switch to PHP?

### All

- HTML:
  - Add `<cite>` tags around each instance of my project titles.
- Style h1, h2, etc. for master CSS.
- Footer:
  - Test mobile responsiveness.

### Music

- Style hover effects and hyperlink underlines.
  - MAKE ALBUM TITLES UNDERLINED AGAIN.
- Make artist names h2. (PROBLEM: <summary> tag is preventing this.)
- Make album titles h3.
- Make song titles h4.

### Screenplays

- Have one page for all screenplays. Each section is 100vh and contains a link to the PDF for that script (pending Mark -- and in some cases Dave's -- approval).
- Some sort of background artwork that I will probably have to commission.
- Image of script's title page slides in from the left.
- Synopsis on the left.
- "Henchmen Wanted" section will also have embedded video of "Expendable."
- Make mobile responsive.
